A program used for updating Pre-Fortress 2.
This program will use PyInstaller for release, but you may run it as a normal script too.
If you wish to build an executable file, install PyInstaller:
``pip install pyinstaller``
then run the command below to install all of the dependencies:
``pip install -r requirements.txt``
then run either ``buildpyinstaller.bat`` for Windows or ``buildpyinstaller.sh`` for Linux.
